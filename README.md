# QRCode shortener

This very small lib allows to generate a very simple and readable QRCode for a given URL. Under the hood, it shortens the url to a 4 characters url (use a small domain too) and generates a QRCode for it. This way, the QRCode is very small and can be printed on a small surface or scanned from a distance.

On top of that, you can access a very simple count stat on the QRCode usage.
